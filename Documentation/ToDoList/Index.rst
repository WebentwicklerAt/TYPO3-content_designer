To-Do list
==========

- ReIntrate the alternative Label function in List Module
- Rewrite the Documentation in ReST (Sphinx).
- Add new feature to extend/create content elements with real Database fields (and not only FlexForm).
- Test it with IRRE Elements and if possible make it possible to include tt_content as IRRE.
- maybe bugfixes?

Feel free to send me feature ideas or help me to optimize and extend this extension, or just support me.
