    :Description:
        Normally, everytime you need a new Content Element Type for “special Content”, you need to write a new Extension. With this extension you can create new Content Elements fast and easy, just with TypoScript or FlexForms. The new CE's will appear in the Content Element Wizard in a special Sheet and Ctype Dropdown.
